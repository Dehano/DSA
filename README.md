This project was deemed to create an efficient music player algorithm for a mobile application. Suppose to have 100 tracks in a  playlist. The playlist works on the concept of linked list, tracks are played one by one. A solution was created using the concept of double linked lists and in addition,I added the functionality to allow for the playing of tracks on repeat (circular). furthermore the playlist algorithm has functionality to play, pause, repeat, skip, back navigate to pervious songs and add/remove songs created in said playlist. lastly there had to be a practical implementation for programming the established algorithm to a working program, which posed major challenges.
